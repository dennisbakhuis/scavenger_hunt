    question: |
      Two rope ladders of identical length and weight which are both in free fall, i.e. falling without any external forces acting on them. The first ladder, ladder A, is above a table. The second ladder, ladder B, is above the ground. The spokes of the ladder are regularly inclined at a small angle. The only difference between the ladders is that the spokes angles are mirrored. See the diagram of the ladder below:

      You are in a room with 3 light switches, each connected to a different bulb in another room. You cannot see the bulbs from where you are. You can turn the switches on or off in any combination. After that, you may enter the room with the bulbs only once. Using your observations, you aim to determine which switch controls which bulb.
