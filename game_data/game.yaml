      Two rope ladders of identical length and weight which are both in free fall, i.e. falling without any external forces acting on them. The first ladder, ladder A, is above a table. The second ladder, ladder B, is above the ground. The spokes of the ladder are regularly inclined at a small angle. The only difference between the ladders is that the spokes angles are mirrored. See the diagram of the ladder below:

      Which of the two ladders will fall faster?
